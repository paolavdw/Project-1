Nutrition and Obesity dimensions: Analysis of physical activity across different age groups in the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 in the US. The scope of our analysis will focus on physical activity in relation to obesity and overweight conditions, percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity, and eating habits in relation to fruit and vegetables consumption. Our findings will identify where the US, as a whole, falls in obesity and overweight, and fruit and vegetables consumption. It will also identify the highest and lowest ranking US state in these two categories among different age groups. The data findings will be used to identify a possible correlation between physical activity and eating habits. This analysis could be a useful tool for US federal and state agencies to develop customized programs to support states with a higher risk of developing obesity-related conditions. <br>
Our analysis was run by the API from The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The BRFSS is the US system of health-related telephone surveys that collects state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. <br>
Overall the statistic summary and visualizations of Obesity and overweight classification on different age-groups indicates: (Sadaf)
a) Observing the mean value of Obesity percentage for different age-groups we can see that obesity percentage generally increase with age especially peaking in the 45 - 54 age range. (The higher the mean value the possibalities of obesity is more on that age-group)
b) Distribution Symmetry: Median values are close to the mean in most age groups, suggesting a generally symmetric distribution of obesity percentages. Slight deviations indicate possible skewness in some groups like 45-54 and 65-older.
C) Variability: The 45-54 and 65+ age groups have the most variation in obesity percentages, showing the widest range of obesity rates among individuals in these groups.<br>
Correlation between eating habits in relation to fruit and vegetables consumption across the US (Paola)
The main takeaways from this analysis based on the eating habits are:
a) The US does not meet minimum requirements of fruit and vegetables as recommended by The U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS). The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise adults should consume 1.5–2 cup-equivalents of fruits and 2–3 cup-equivalents of vegetables daily. Only 12-10% of surveyed adults met fruit and vegetables intake recommendations.
b) On average, 29.97% of the US respondents consumes daily recommendations of fruit and vegetables. The standard deviation on this average is 8.98% which may suggest that
the values in the dataset are fairly reliable.
c) Adults who reported consuming fruit less than once time daily are mainly located in the southeast of the US (highest and lowest rankings).
4.) Adults who reported consuming vegetables less than once time daily are also located in the southeast of the US. The least number of adults who reported consuming vegetables less than once time daily are located in the New England region of the US (most of them being in Maine).
d) Age seems to play an important role in the consumption of fruits and vegatbles. We notice a pattern of decreasing percentages as respondents get older (the older you get, the healthier choices you make in your fruit/vegetable intake).
e) Other factors that may have an effect on this findings are: geographical location, socio-economic status, cost, access, and nutrional education.<br>
Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity (Roger)
a) The sample comprises the 50 USA states with a sample size 12,000 per state based on each age group. A pie chart was used to show the number of individuals with little or no activity leading to obesity.
b) Pie-Chart:
  o Showed a sample size of 12,000 individuals who had little or no exercise<br>
